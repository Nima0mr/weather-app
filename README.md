# weather-app
This educational project serves as a comprehensive guide for software development, guiding students through the entire process from design to software testing.

Focused on weather-related applications, it provides hands-on experience in implementing real-time weather information and forecasts.

Using **tailwind css** and **react js**, students will gain practical insights into software development best practices.

Explore the project to enhance your skills in designing, coding, and testing software applications.
